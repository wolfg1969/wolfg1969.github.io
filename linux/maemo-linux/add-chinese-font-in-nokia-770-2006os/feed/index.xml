		<description><![CDATA[I have been following the eight-step instructions to install Chinese fonts on my Nokia 770. I have installed x-terminal and now I am trying to find the fireflysung.ttf font at www.study-area.org/apt/firefly-font/. However all I can find are .gz files. Can someone give me some guidance as to how to convert them to .ttf files? I am hoping to install Traditional Chinese fonts. Can you tell me which .gz files contain them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi!! 

I just new user of n800 and I tried to install Korean Lnaguage pack.

I installed CJK file but it just worked for input Korean.

So, I tried to step what you already posting at internettablettalk.

I installed X-term, copy some font files to my mmc1.

but I couldn&#039;t Copy some fonts to /usr/share/fonts/

when I typed &quot;cp media/mmc1/ usr/share/fonts/&quot; i just could see &quot;EXISTS&quot;..

and I can&#039;t use MDIR.- &quot;permission denied&quot;

....how can I copy these fonts files to usr/share/fonts/ ?

I had never studied LINUX..so I don&#039;t have any Idea about it.. 

Thank you
June]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wolfg, I just wanted to thank the work you&#039;ve put into investigating this issue. Thanks to your summary for installing Chinese localization and fonts, I&#039;ve been able to read Japanese on my 770 by following the same proccess. I&#039;ve gotten positive feedback on my Japanese instructions, so I know there are (at least a few) 770 users in Japan that are appreciative of your findings. keep up the good work :-)]]></description>
